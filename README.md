# ✨ Reverie: Let AI Curate Your Memories ✨

*A whimsical tool for thoughtful scrapbooking*  
🖼️ *"Upload your photos. Let your story arrange itself."*

## 🧩 The Problem

**Scrapbooking is hard.**  

- Too many layout choices  
- Takes time and creative energy  
- Most people get stuck on *how* to start  

🧠 **Our thought:**  
> What if AI could do the thinking — but in your style?

## The Idea

**Reverie = AI layout generation for scrapbooks**  

**Upload ➝ Understand ➝ Arrange**  

**How it works:**  
1. Upload a batch of photos  
2. Model detects themes, faces, moods  
3. Layout engine generates pages  
4. User picks, tweaks, prints
